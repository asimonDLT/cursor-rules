# TypeScript/Web Development Standards

- **Package Management:** Always use **pnpm** for Node.js projects.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Always use **Biome** for both linting and code formatting. `Prettier` is a fallback.
- **Build Tool:** Default new web projects to **Vite** for fast development and builds.
- **ORM:** Use **Prisma** for type-safe database access and schema management.
- **Testing Framework:** Use **Vitest** for unit and integration tests.
- **E2E Testing:** Use **Playwright** for end-to-end browser testing.
- **Test Organization:** Co-locate tests with source code using `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` extensions.
- **Runtime:** Target **Node.js 20.***
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Variables/Functions: `camelCase`
  - Components/Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Files/CSS: `kebab-case`
