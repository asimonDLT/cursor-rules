# Container & Deployment Standards

- **Container Images:** Generate multi-stage Dockerfiles with slim base images (e.g., `python:3.12-slim`).
- **Deployment Strategy:** Structure code to support blue-green deployments when applicable.
- **Resource Optimization:** Design containers for efficient resource usage and fast startup times.
