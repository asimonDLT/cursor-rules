# AWS-Focused Infrastructure Standards

- **Cloud Provider:** Prioritize **AWS** for all cloud-based services and infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use **AWS CloudFormation** templates in **YAML** format.
- **CLI Tools:** Use **AWS CLI** for deployment and infrastructure management scripts.
- **SDK Usage:** Use **boto3** for Python projects, appropriate AWS SDKs for other languages when there's clear advantage.
- **Security:** Generate IAM roles and policies with least privilege. Assume **CloudTrail** and **GuardDuty** are enabled.
- **Secrets Management:** Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **Parameter Store** for production secrets.
- **Monitoring:** Generate code that includes health check endpoints. Assume **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and alerting.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Prefer serverless (**AWS Lambda**) or managed containers (**AWS ECS/Fargate**).
- **Naming Convention:** Use `PascalCase` for CloudFormation resources.
